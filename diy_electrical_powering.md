# DIY Electric Power System

You'll find insightful resources about creating your own power system and produce your own electricity.

This will like trip toward electrical autonomy with various topics being discussed such as storage, production, delivery,

Each stage will try to reach a specific goal always more ambitious:
- powering ultra low consumption device: arduino, rapsberry pi
- power small electronic devices (tablet, external screen) up-to 18W using power bank
- build 12V power supply from custom battery pack and solar panels
- charge cordless battery tool (up to 24V)
- 100W devices powering using USB-C PD norm
- AC

## Must have equipment
Before starting, you'll need to invest in some indispensable tools to work properly and efficiently.

### measuring equipment and devices
- multimeter: for everything
- usb power measuring tool: check your current consumption/production
- usb PD trigger: take benefit of latest Power Delivery USB standard to power devices requiring up to 20V and 5A which means 100W!

### Misc materials
- connectors: Jack, XT60, wago
- wires

### storage/power supply
- powerbanks
- 18650 batteries

## Safety

### Common mistakes
Be careful about mistake, this happens much more often than we think, and will result in burning wire, 
smoke, damage on equipment/devices/cells and even more serious consequences depending on it.

This is really annoying seeing things broken due to small inattention.

Among my "favorites":
- short circuit: bad design, lack of connectors, tinkering
- wrong polarity: contrary to AC, DC cares about polarity and many devices aren't protected against it. 
So better be careful before plugin things such as car charger which suppose polarity to be correct. 
I allready burnt 2 small car charger.. fortunately this isn't big things but still annoying to stupidily brake devices

### Solutions
- use fuses
- use BMS to protect 18650 packs
- use safe connectors, not ones you made yourself 
- always think twice before doing something. Check polarities.
